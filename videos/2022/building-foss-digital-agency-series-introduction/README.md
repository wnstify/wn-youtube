## Description

...
This series will be all about free and open source software that you can self host on your own servers. In Europe, we must try to comply with all GDPR regulations, when we are working with customer/clients data and on-premises software can help us greatly achieve 3rd party software independence and to stay compliant, because all data will stay on your own server.

We will be focusing on mainstream alternatives to various products like Google Workspace, Google Analytics, Airtable, Plesk/Cpanel and many more.

Let’s assume that we are just starting out our journey to build a digital agency, specializing in web development. Our main goal is to offer complete in-house solutions and minimize dependency on 3rd party software. By doing this, we can greatly reduce our costs to a minimum, since we are just starting out and do not have clients yet.

Our starting out budget is 50€/month and we try to keep our costs to a minimum, if possible.

Phase A
First phase will be all about setting up our secured environments, obtaining domain names that support custom nameservers and glue records and our own DNS server, so we have everything prepared for other phases.

Part 1 - Deploying dedicated VPN for our new business
Part 2 - Obtaining domain & setup Cyberpanel as our main DNS server
Part 3 - Configuring emails & SMTP
Part 4 - Setup Portainer and install Vaultwarden Password Manager
