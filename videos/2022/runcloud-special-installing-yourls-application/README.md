## Description

.....
I would really wanted to thank you for your support and we just reached 100 subscribers!

For me this is great achievement and I am happy to see, that my videos & tutorials are helping you to set up your applications and learn new things.

I have many things in my to-do list to cover on this channel, scheduled for rest of this year and next year, so there are many great things coming.

This will be special episode and we will be covering Your Own URL Shortener application and how you can set it up on your Runcloud server!

What is YOURLS
YOURLS stands for Your Own URL Shortener. It is a small set of PHP scripts that will allow you to run your own URL shortening service (a la TinyURL or Bitly).

Running your own URL shortener is fun, geeky and useful: you own your data and don't depend on third-party services. It's also a great way to add branding to your short URLs, instead of using the same public URL shortener everyone uses.
