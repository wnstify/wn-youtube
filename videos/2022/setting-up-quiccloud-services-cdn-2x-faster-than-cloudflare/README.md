## Description

.....
Welcome to the second part of Quic.cloud series!

Quic.cloud is the First and Only Complete WordPress Optimization Solution. 

We will setup CDN integration with quic.cloud and walk you through some settings, that I recommend to use on every install.

Also you will be able to see performance vs Cloudflare!

In short quic.cloud CDN is 2x times faster than standard Cloudflare settings out of the box. @quiccloud Well done !
