## Description

--
In this part 5 of the series, I will walk you through the following: · Creating WordPress Canvas/Blueprint  

Cloudflare Firewall Rule to protect your plugin storage: 
(http.host contains "canvas.webnestify.uk" and ip.src ne 0.0.0.0)  

Create a new Firewall Rule and add your expression or add it manually according to this video. Please change 0.0.0.0 for the IP of your server, and the URL that you created.

After you have your blueprint installed, configure and activate all of your plugins and themes, so you can clone the blueprint in the future to save time.  

You might also say, why use Canvas, when you can create an app and configure plugins without this feature?  

The answer is simple. Canvas will give you starting point without default bloatware preinstalled and make your WordPress installation cleaner.
