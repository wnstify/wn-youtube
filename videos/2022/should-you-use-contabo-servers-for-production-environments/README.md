## Description

I have been asked many times, why I am not using Contabo servers for my applications and business environments.

This video is here to answer your question.

I don't recommend using Contabo servers for production/live environments because of following reasons:

• Lack of  HW firewall
• No backups
• Only 200 Mbit/s connection
• Bad IP reputation
• Server Monitoring Paywall
• Outdated Cloud Panel
• Very slow SSD performance
• Poor DDoS protection

I only recommend using Contabo servers for learning server stuff, playing with Docker and other dev purposes.
