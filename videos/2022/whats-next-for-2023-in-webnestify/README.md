## Description

....
To begin with, I want to thank you for your commitment and support throughout this past year. I wanted to give you an overview of the year 2022 and let you know what I have in store for this channel in 2023.

This past year has been a great success for Webnestify. We have welcomed many agencies, freelancers, and business owners worldwide to make their web development process simpler and to provide them with cutting-edge technology. 
I have also set up a Webnestify YouTube channel to guide others with their deployments, and managing services, and to practice some security best practices. 
Furthermore, I have put together a documentation site, where one can access step-by-step guides to get started with some of the most reliable open-source applications and provide greater value to your clients.

And in December, Webnestify become a quic.cloud partner to deliver high-end CDN performance in Europe. Thank you Litespeed and quic.cloud team for the amazing support!

So what I have planned for 2023?

Youtube channel:

I have just started completely new series, where I will build a digital agency only on open source & self-hosted software whenever possible. This series will take some time to complete, as there are so many great applications and technology, that I want to cover with full step-by-setp documentation.

Later in 2023, I will start doing comparisons videos, where I will compare different cloud server providers, cloud hosting stacks, and many more. 

I will start doing monthly or weekly digests regarding breaches and security vulnerabilities around the world. Still deciding which format I will use for that.

Another thing, that I want to start is live streaming more comprehensive setups like advanced security for servers, docker, and other services that I am using in my business.

Webnestify:

I am currently working on a new project, that could help anyone deploy open-source self-hosted applications with one click. I cannot say more details at the moment, but it will be a game-changer for many of you. Stay tuned for that. 

Finally, I will finish webnestify.cloud website in Q1 and also do some blogging, which could potentially go well with the documentation site. 

One big change, that I am planning to do is to hire full-time some skilled system admins to help me offload some work, so I can focus more on growing Webnestify and getting the name out. 

Lastly, I will launch a training portal, where everyone can get knowledge and some experience with technology in production environments. 

It probably doesn't sound to much, but those things offer a tremendious value to everyone and also it makes me happy to see how is Webnestify helping business around the world. 

So to wrap things up, I just want to thank you all once again and I am wishing you succesfull year 2023!
