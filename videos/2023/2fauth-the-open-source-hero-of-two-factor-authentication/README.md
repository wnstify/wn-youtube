In the digital age, securing our online accounts is more crucial than ever.

Enter 2FAuth – a web-based, self-hosted alternative to One-Time Passcode (OTP) generators like Google Authenticator. Designed for both mobile and desktop users, 2FAuth stands out as a versatile and user-friendly solution for enhancing your digital security.
