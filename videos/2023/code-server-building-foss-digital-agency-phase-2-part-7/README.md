This series will be all about free and open-source software you can self-host on your servers. We must comply with all GDPR regulations in Europe when working with customer/client data. On-premises software can help us greatly achieve 3rd party software independence and stay compliant because all data will remain on your own server.

We will focus on mainstream alternatives to various products like Google Workspace, Google Analytics, Airtable, Plesk/Cpanel, and many more.

Let’s assume that we are just starting out our journey to build a digital agency, specializing in web development. Our main goal is to offer complete in-house solutions and minimize dependency on 3rd party software. By doing this, we can reduce our costs to a minimum, since we are just starting out and do not have clients yet.

Our starting out budget is 50€/month and we try to keep our costs to a minimum, if possible.
