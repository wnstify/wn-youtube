## Description

....
Cryptgeon is a secure, open-source note and file sharing service inspired by PrivNote. It uses a 256-bit ID and key for each note, with client-side AES encryption in GCM mode to ensure that the server cannot decrypt the contents. Data is stored in memory without persistence, and features include view and time constraints for added security.
