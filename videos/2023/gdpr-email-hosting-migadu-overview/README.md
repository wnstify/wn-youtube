## Description

....
Migadu is a Switzerland-based email hosting provider that specializes in offering email services to all businesses and individuals.

Features:

Unlimited Mailboxes: Their plans typically include unlimited mailboxes, meaning you can create as many email accounts under your domain as you need.

Webmail and Client Compatibility: Migadu provides a webmail interface, but you can also set up your email on a variety of clients (like Outlook, Thunderbird, etc.) or devices using IMAP/POP and SMTP.

Aliases and Domain Aliases: Migadu supports creating aliases (alternative email addresses for an existing mailbox) and domain aliases (alternative domain names for the primary one).

Autoresponders: You can set up automatic response messages.

Security Features: They use encryption for data transfer, and they also provide spam filtering.

Transparent Pricing: Migadu operates on a flat-rate pricing model. You pay based on outgoing messages rather than the number of users or aliases.
