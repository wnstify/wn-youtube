What is Nextcloud?

Nextcloud is a free, open-source file hosting and collaboration platform that can be installed on a web server. It allows users to store, share and sync files and data across multiple devices and platforms. It also includes collaboration features such as calendar and contact syncing, online document editing, and real-time chat. Nextcloud is a self-hosted alternative to services like Dropbox, Google Workspace and Microsoft 365.
