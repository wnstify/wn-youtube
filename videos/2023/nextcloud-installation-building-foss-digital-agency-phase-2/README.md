## Description

...
Starting phase 2 strong, we will install our own Nextcloud instance!

What is Nextcloud?

Nextcloud is a free, open-source file hosting and collaboration platform that can be installed on a web server. It allows users to store, share and sync files and data across multiple devices and platforms. It also includes collaboration features such as calendar and contact syncing, online document editing, and real-time chat. Nextcloud is a self-hosted alternative to services like Dropbox, Google Workspace and Microsoft 365.

This series will be all about free and open-source software that you can self-host on your own servers. In Europe, we must try to comply with all GDPR regulations, when we are working with customer/client data, and on-premises software can help us greatly achieve 3rd party software independence and stay compliant because all data will remain on your own server.

We will focus on mainstream alternatives to various products like Google Workspace, Google Analytics, Airtable, Plesk/Cpanel, and many more.

Let’s assume that we are just starting out our journey to build a digital agency, specializing in web development. Our main goal is to offer complete in-house solutions and minimize dependency on 3rd party software. By doing this, we can reduce our costs to a minimum, since we are just starting out and do not have clients yet.

Our starting out budget is 50€/month and we try to keep our costs to a minimum, if possible.
