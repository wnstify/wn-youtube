Honestly, I don't understand what is the main selling point of PeakFreq when most useful features are behind paywall (at least for me). https://gridpane.com/kb/peakfreq-managed-hosting/#scope

By the end of the day, I see the point and the need for Cloudways competitor, because CW is going downhill day by day and their support is really useless. So I would recommend ditching them and switch to PeakFreq. 

I hope that GP team will specify more details about what exactly is included in server management (tasks, AV testing, etc.) and release some great features that are behind paywall at the moment. 

It is a new product at it can take time to get it right and reduce waiting time 😉

If you want to have all useful features and have option to use Litespeed, Runcloud is superior to Gridpane & PeakFreq stack.
