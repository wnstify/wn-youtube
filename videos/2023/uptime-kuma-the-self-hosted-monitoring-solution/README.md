## Description

.....
Uptime Kuma is an open-source, self-hosted monitoring tool to check if your websites, applications, and services are up and running.

Uptime Kuma provides a simple and clear user interface to monitor whether your services are online or offline. You can configure it to check your services at regular intervals and provide notifications if anything goes down. It supports multiple types of notifications, such as emails, Slack messages, Telegram messages, and others, depending on the version.

NGINX Proxy Manager was developed as a Docker container to provide a simple, graphical user interface (GUI) for managing your NGINX environment. It allows you to easily route incoming HTTP and HTTPS traffic to various internal servers, manage SSL certificates, and redirect traffic from one URL to another, all without having to dive into complex configuration files.

Watchtower is a Docker application designed to automate the process of updating your Docker containers with the latest images. Containers, once deployed, can become outdated as new images are released. Traditionally, you would need to manually stop the running container, pull the latest image, and then restart the container using the new image. Watchtower automates this process.

The way Watchtower works is simple: it periodically checks the Docker Hub registry (or other registries you've set up) for new images of the containers that you're running. If it finds a newer image, it will automatically pull this image, gracefully shut down the existing container, and then start a new container with the updated image, while preserving the options and volumes from the original container.
