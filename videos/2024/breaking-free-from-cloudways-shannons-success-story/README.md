🔥 Join us as Shannon Payne, a freelance web developer from Canberra, Australia, shares her transformative journey with Webnestify. After facing challenges with her previous hosting service, including skyrocketing costs and declining support, Shannon made the leap to Webnestify. Discover how this switch not only resolved her pricing and performance issues but also significantly improved her service offerings and client satisfaction.

🚀 Key Highlights:

Challenges with Cloudways: Shannon faced several issues with Cloudways, including significant price increases that tripled her costs, server overloads, and a decline in customer support quality. These challenges threatened the profitability and sustainability of her services.

Decision to Switch to Webnestify: The catalyst for Shannon's switch was the combination of unaffordable pricing, technical problems with servers, and unsatisfactory support from Cloudways, especially after its servers were acquired by Digital Ocean.

Immediate Benefits of Moving to Webnestify: Upon switching, Shannon noticed a drastic improvement in the backend speed of websites, more affordable pricing, and exceptional customer support from Webnestify, which starkly contrasted with her previous experience.

Managed Service and Enhanced Security: Webnestify's managed services and robust security measures provided Shannon with peace of mind, eliminating the need for security plugins like Wordfence and ensuring her websites remained secure without any incidents.

Business Impact: The transition to Webnestify allowed Shannon to increase her service rates by 20-30% for some clients due to the enhanced value she could now offer. This rate increase led to improved revenue and client satisfaction.

Customer Support and Global Reach: Despite initial concerns about time zones and location differences, Shannon praises Webnestify's prompt and effective support system, which includes a global team capable of addressing issues quickly, regardless of her location in Australia.
