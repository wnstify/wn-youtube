## Description

.......
Enhance is a comprehensive hosting control panel designed for modern web hosting needs, offering a wide range of features to support web hosts, developers, and website owners. Its main advantages include a powerful multi-server hosting environment, secure and containerized websites, and built-in incremental backups, which make it a viable alternative to traditional control panels like cPanel and Plesk​.

The platform is designed to simplify server deployment and management with features such as zero-config scaling, website placement rules, resource usage management, and support for multiple web server types like Apache, NGINX, LiteSpeed, and OpenLiteSpeed. It offers robust security measures including role and website containerization, brute force protection, SSL/TLS support, and two-factor authentication to ensure a secure hosting environment.

Enhance is tailored for web hosting companies, providing a scalable platform that grows with your business without per-server license costs. It enables smart website placement, containerized server roles, and a unified platform for team management. The control panel is user-friendly and responsive, designed with both novice and advanced users in mind, incorporating tools for website management, backups, SSLs, and more.
