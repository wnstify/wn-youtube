## Description

.......
Welcome to our series on Zero Trust security! In this first episode, we'll explore a critical aspect of modern cybersecurity practices: separating personal and business workspaces to enhance security. As the boundaries between personal and professional lives blur, especially in today's increasingly remote work environment, the risks associated with using the same devices for both personal and business activities have significantly escalated.

We'll begin by discussing common problems faced when personal and business environments are mixed, such as increased vulnerability to cyber threats and the complications arising from data breaches. We will also address the severe consequences of personal devices being stolen or lost, highlighting how these events can expose business data and disrupt operations.

Following this, we will introduce virtual machines (VMs) as a robust solution to these challenges. VMs allow us to create isolated and secure environments on a single physical device, ensuring that business operations are safeguarded against the security shortcomings of personal device usage. This episode will guide you through setting up a virtual machine using popular tools, configuring it for maximum security, and managing it efficiently.

By the end of this session, you'll understand why using VMs is a crucial strategy for any business looking to implement Zero Trust principles and enhance their overall security posture. Let's dive in and discover how to protect your business with advanced, yet accessible, technological solutions.
