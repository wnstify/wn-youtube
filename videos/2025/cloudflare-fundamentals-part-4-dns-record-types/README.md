## Description

.......
🚀 Welcome to Part 4 of the Cloudflare Fundamentals course! Today, we’re breaking down the most important DNS record types that every website owner needs to know. Whether you’re managing a WordPress site, setting up emails, or securing your domain, understanding these records is crucial for keeping everything running smoothly.

📌 In This Video, You’ll Learn:
✅ What DNS is and why it matters
✅ A Record, AAAA Record, CNAME Record
✅ MX Record (for email), TXT Record (verification & security)
✅ CAA Record (SSL certificate control)
✅ TTL (Time to Live) – how DNS caching works

We’ll also walk you through how to set up these DNS records in Cloudflare and common mistakes to avoid (like breaking your email by proxying MX records—don’t worry, we’ve all done it).

💡 Cloudflare DNS is one of the fastest and most secure in the world, so mastering these settings is a must if you want to get the best performance and security for your website.
