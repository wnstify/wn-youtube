## Description

.......
Welcome to our *Definitive Self-Hosting Guide* - your one-stop destination for mastering secure, efficient self-hosting for the future. Whether you're a seasoned pro or just stepping into the self-hosting world, this guide is tailored just for you.

This video will unlock essential insights into self-hosting, focusing on the pillars of complete data ownership, security, and unified user access. We'll introduce you to the exceptional tools of Pangolin and Authentik, and guide you on how to use them to their fullest potential. Pangolin will act as a reverse proxy providing secure, tunneled access to self-hosted apps with wildcard SSL. Authentik will streamline user management, showing how it seamlessly integrates and manages unified access in any kind of environment, although it's optional, it's highly recommended for serious self-hosters.

We'll also dive into the technicalities of setting up servers, whether on your own hardware or with our recommended cloud provider - Hetzner. You'll learn how to create a private subnet to ensure secure intra-server communication, and we'll also navigate through the process of integrating CrowdSec to keep your apps protected round the clock.

Expect to walk away with an understanding of how these tools and processes contribute to offering you absolute control and confidence in self-hosting. This guide is your stepping stone towards achieving a secure, efficient, and powerful self-hosting setup that is future-proof.
