## Description

.......
💡 Want to simplify DNS, reduce errors, and take full control of client domain setups — even when you don’t have access to their DNS accounts?

This video shows how to manage DNS like a pro using CNAME flattening — a powerful feature supported by providers like Cloudflare. It’s perfect for agencies, freelancers, hosting resellers, or anyone managing multiple websites or environments.

📌 Covered in this video:
✅ How CNAME flattening makes root domain pointing more flexible
✅ How to centralize DNS records for staging, dev, and production servers
✅ The smarter way to handle client domains — no full access required
✅ Real-world use cases and setup examples using Cloudflare

Even though traditional DNS rules don’t support CNAME records at the root level, modern DNS providers like Cloudflare offer a workaround — helping you create a single source of truth and scale your infrastructure cleanly.
