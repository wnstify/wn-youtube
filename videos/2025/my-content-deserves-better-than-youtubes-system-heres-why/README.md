## Description

My Content Deserves Better Than YouTube’s System — and today I want to explain why.

A few weeks ago, I enabled YouTube Memberships so I could finally share deeper guides, longer tutorials, and more advanced content around open-source tools, self-hosting, security, and the apps we all love.

What I didn’t expect was a massive drop in watch time and video recommendations.
YouTube’s algorithm punished the entire channel the moment I turned memberships on.
Fewer people discovered new videos. Watch time dropped. Recommendations disappeared.

This made me step back and rethink everything.

So in this video, I’m explaining the full story:

✅ Why YouTube Memberships hurt my channel
✅ Why my most important content can’t even be published on YouTube
✅ The type of community platform I’m building
✅ What happens to premium content, courses, and Q/A sessions
✅ And why I believe we deserve something better than YouTube’s system

I’ll still be publishing all regular videos here — nothing changes about that.
But the deeper, premium, unrestricted content will live on a platform that we control.

Also: Thank you to all current members who supported me.
It means the world to me and confirms that this content is truly worth creating.

Right now I’m looking for the right platform to host everything. If you know something open-source, privacy-friendly, secure (with passkeys/2FA — it’s 2025!), and great for creators… let me know in the comments.

Big things are coming — hopefully before Black Friday.
If not, there will be a limited lifetime deal at launch.
