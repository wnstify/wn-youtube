❗️ Why I’m Done With Cloudflare Tunnels – Meet Pangolin: The Self-Hosted Zero Trust Access Solution

After a 2.5-hour Cloudflare Access & Tunnel outage that took down my services, I knew it was time to take back control. That’s when I found Pangolin — a self-hosted tunneled reverse proxy with built-in identity and access control.

In this video, I cover everything you need to know about Pangolin — setup, features, use cases, and why it’s a game-changing alternative to Cloudflare Tunnels and Access.
