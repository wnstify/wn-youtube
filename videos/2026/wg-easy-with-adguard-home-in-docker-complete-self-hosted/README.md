## Description

.......
Build a secure VPN with network-wide ad blocking using WG Easy and AdGuard Home. A modern, actively maintained alternative to Mistborn with better features and ongoing development.

Mistborn development has slowed significantly. You don't need to wait. WG Easy plus AdGuard Home gives you the same core functionality with cleaner interfaces and active communities. This tutorial walks you through the complete setup using Docker Compose.

Complete setup files and Docker Compose configuration available on GitHub (link below).

❤️ *OPEN SOURCE THANK YOU*

A huge thank you to the *WG Easy team* for creating and maintaining WG Easy as an open-source project. Their work makes WireGuard VPN accessible to everyone without complex configuration.

Thank you to *AdGuard Team* for AdGuard Home. Network-wide ad and tracker blocking should be easy to deploy. Their clean interface and powerful filtering make DNS security approachable for self-hosters.
